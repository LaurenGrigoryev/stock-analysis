# **stock-analysis**

*Project Overview*
The purpose of this analysis was to look for returns on stocks in 2017 and 2018 at a faster rate than previous code allowed.

*Results*
I could not debug the refactored code enough to get results before midnight. [Warning Message](https://github.com/LaurenSonis/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
 

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
