# **stock-analysis**

*Project Overview*
The purpose of this analysis was to look for returns on stocks in 2017 and 2018 at a faster rate than previous code allowed.

*Results*
I could not debug the refactored code enough to get results before midnight. [Warning Message](https://github.com/LaurenSonis/stock-analysis/blob/main/screenshotwarningmessage.png)
The original script shows a Syntax Error. [Syntax Error]()
