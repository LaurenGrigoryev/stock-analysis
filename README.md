# **stock-analysis**

*Project Overview*
The purpose of this analysis was to look for returns on stocks in 2017 and 2018 at a faster rate than previous code allowed.

*Results*

I could not debug the refactored code enough to get results before midnight. [Warning Message](https://github.com/LaurenSonis/stock-analysis/blob/main/screenshotwarningmessage.png)

The original script shows a Syntax Error. [Syntax Error](https://github.com/LaurenSonis/stock-analysis/blob/main/SyntaxError.png)

*Summary*

One of the advantages to refactoring code is that you have the opportunity to speed up the process of data evaluation. One disadvantage is that it can be time consuming to refactor the code. I would recommend evaluating how quickly the current code is running or could run for future projects before taking time to refactor.

Another advantage to refactoring code is that you have a chance to have a second set of eyes evaluate someone else's code and potentially improve it for accuracy. Another disadvantage is that with two hands in the pot so to speak, the risk for human error increases.

For the original and refactored VBA script, the advantage for this data analyst in training was the chance to see how script could be set up without having to write the code from scratch. This was educational and a huge time saver for me. One disadvantage in refactoring this script was that I was not able to debug my own work well enough to provide working code.
